# 6aweb-final-requirement
This is an animal rights advocacy website that serves as our final requirement in our Advanced Dynamic Web Applications (6AWEB) college course in Holy Angel University.

## Application Background
Animals are a fundamental part of our existence, bringing us companionship, love, emotional support, and even contributing happiness to our society. Despite that, some pets are cruelly treated, exploited and neglected, resulting in fighting for survival on the streets. PARA_DEVS created this website to advocate animal rights and instill to the people in Pampanga the importance of taking care of such animals and how adopting one will greatly help in reducing the number of suffering animals today.

## Framework
The framework used for this project is Angular (v18).

## Components
